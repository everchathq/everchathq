# Everchat

Everchat is the place to build communities. Our goal is to deliver equality and democratization into the community decision-making process. 

Everchat is:
- **Democratized** - Everchat communities have no admins. Instead, we give power to the community members.
- **Anonymous** - Everchat encourages the use of pseudonyms to make sure your identity won’t get compromised.
- **Censorless** - Everchat doesn’t monitor what you post, but interferes if any criminal activity is reported.
- **Free** - Everchat is free forever, but we’ll be introducing a paid `Pro` tier in the future.
