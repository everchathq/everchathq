# Everchat

Everchat is an app where people can build communities and talk about topics that matter to them in the easiest way ever. Nowadays, community social networks are overly complicated; they collect and sell your data to advertisers (and other 3rd parties), and most sadly, if they don't like your opinion—they censor you. These are some of the many reasons why we decided to build Everchat for you.

# Company

In 2015, Everchat started as a simple Chrome extension idea that would allow people to leave comments on any website out there. Its goal was to give people the ability to express towards any topic, website, article, etc. Despite many trials and errors, it's been in the ideation phase for a long time. In December 2019, we realized a more significant potential of this solution by creating a dedicated communication service supported by the extension. By doing this, we can deliver a much better experience for everyone.

<br/>

### Mission

> "Our mission is to empower Internet users worldwide by giving them a place to realize themselves."

<br/>

### Vision

> "Our vision is to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_freedom">Internet freedom</a> possible for everyone. We think people-first and want to create a fair, safe, and transparent environment for all Internet users."

<br/>

### Beliefs

Fundamentally we strongly believe in egalitarianism (the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities). Yet, almost every day, we experience today's social platforms taking advantage of their users. From selling data to advertisers, all the way to political and individual censorship. We do not want to get treated and thought of as a piece of data ourselves, and that's why we pledge that we will never sell any customer data to any 3rd party ever.

We strive to achieve and operate based on three basic freedoms:
- Freedom of speech
- Freedom of information
- Freedom of the press
