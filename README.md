## Values

- **Democratized** 💪 - Communities have no central source of power. We give power to their members.
- **Anonymous** 🤡 - We encourage the use of pseudonyms to make sure your identity won’t get compromised.
- **Censorless** 📢 - We do not monitor what you post, but interfere if any criminal activity is reported.
- **Free** 🚀 - Everchat is free and ad-free, but a paid `Pro` tier is on our roadmap.

<br/>

## Mission

Our mission is to equalize, democratize, and decentralize community decisions.
