# Everchat

Everchat is a cross-platform web app where people can build communities and talk about topics that matter to them in the easiest way ever. Nowadays, community-building tools out there have one central source of power—the admins. We see this as a problem in community development and equality as such. That's why we focus on delivering the best possible experience to you—the individual.

<br/>

### USPs

- **Democratic** 💪 - Everchat communities have no central source of power. The power is distributed among all members equally.
- **Anonymous** 🤡 - Everchat encourages the use of pseudonyms to make sure your identity will not get compromised.
- **Censorless** 📢 - Everchat does not monitor what you post, but we take criminal activity very seriously.
- **Free** 🚀 - Everchat is free and ad-free, but a paid `Pro` tier is on our roadmap.

# Company

Everchat started as a simple Chrome extension idea that would allow people to leave comments on any website out there. Later, we realized a much more significant potential of this application by creating a dedicated communication service. This extension will support delivering a better experience later on when introduced as an add-on to the main app.
